# 1.1 Win Conditions & Prizes

**NOTE: More surprise prizes may be announced during the game !**

This rounds primary win condition is proximity to the center of the universe. This idea was first explored in *Dark Forest v0.6 Round 3: Grape Extra-Small.*

Players can claim one planet every 4 hours, and their score will update to reflect how far away it is from the center of the universe. Be careful though, as if the planet is destroyed, then its score wont count, and your score will update to your next closest claimed planet.

Please note, that only planets of level 3+ can be claimed for score. You will need to fight for the closest planets, or maybe considering destroying your enemies planets!

*The prizes will mainly be divided into three parts.*

Part I : Artifacts 

After player withdraw artifacts through spacetime rip, they can transfer the ERC721 artifacts from the game contract to their player account.

Part II: Ares Epic 

All players who get score will receive Ares Epic NFT. 

Ares Epic will be generated directly from the data in game contract.

The specific design will be announced after the game ends. 

Below is the AresLoot for round 2, which can serve as a reference.

NOTE: Union rankings will determine the rarity of Epic NFTs.

Part III: USDC & ETH prize pool

Prize Pool = 1300 **USDC**

**In Round 4, rewards are determined by union rankings.** Union points are based on the individual rankings of union members. Here‚Äôs the conversion table for individual rankings to union points:

| Individual ranking | contribution to union ranking points |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 200 |
| 2 | 160 |
| 3 | 140 |
| 4 | 120 |
| 5 | 100 |
| 6-10 | 90 |
| 11-20 | 80 |
| 21-30 | 70 |
| 31-50 | 60 |
| 51-100 | 50 |
| 101-200 | 40 |
| 201-300 | 30 |
| 301-500 | 20 |
| 501-1000 | 10 |
| 1000+ | 5 |

For example, if a union has members ranked 1st, 5th, and 40th, the total points would be: 200 + 100 + 60 = 360. üåü

Union rankings are based on the total points. In case of a tie, we‚Äôll use the highest individual player ranking within the union to decide the ranking. üèÜ

Union rankings will determine the distribution of USDC and the rarity of Epic NFTs.  

The USDC prizes will go directly to the union leader, who can distribute the funds within the union as they see fit.  **Please note, the amounts listed below are for the entire union, not individual players. ‚ö†Ô∏è**

| union ranking | DFArchon support | **AGLD DAO support** | SUM |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 500  USDC | **150 USDC** | 650 USDC |
| 2 | 300  USDC | **100 USDC** | 400 USDC |
| 3 | 200  USDC | **50 USDC** | 250 USDC |
| 4-6 | 100 USDC |  |  |

**AGLD DAO support prize pool is 1500 USDC, with 20% (300 USDC) awarded to the 3 three teams on DFAres Round 4.
When these teams advance to the Dark Forest community round on Adventure Layer , they need to continue competing and secure a top-three finish again to receive the remaining 80% (1200 USDC).**

You can check player and union ranks in the **Score Board plugin** and **Union Pane**.
