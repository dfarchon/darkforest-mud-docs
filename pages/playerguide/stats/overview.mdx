### **Basic Explanations**

*Energy Capacity* and *Energy Generation* are your main resources when it comes to expanding your empire and warring with other empires.

*Defense* relates to that damage you will take, or will inflict upon an opponent when an “unfriendly” move is sent.

*Range* determines how far energy can be sent, and how effective it will be when it lands.

*Speed* determines how quickly a move will cross the universe.

*Silver Capacity* refers to the maximum amount of silver which can be held, and *Silver Generation* refers to how quickly silver will be created (asteroid fields only).
