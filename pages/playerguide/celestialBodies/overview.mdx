# Celestial Bodies

# Overview

Since a celestial body is the first thing you will encounter in the game (you spawn on one!), we will begin the guide here.

Within the game, there are currently five different types of celestial bodies that can spawn. They are the ‘[Asteroid Field](https://www.notion.so/Asteroid-Field-ebb70f5221ab48f09d96a7edac6adee3?pvs=21)’, ‘[Foundry](https://www.notion.so/Foundry-1a8275f435fa453daefdf63541300b7a?pvs=21)’, ‘[Planet](https://www.notion.so/Planet-8c1d89c39b514255a66d15666237b50c?pvs=21)’, ‘[Quasar](https://www.notion.so/Quasar-a3f99a6dc4ae4c93af4bc0258934d24b?pvs=21)’ and ‘[Spacetime Rip](https://www.notion.so/Spacetime-Rip-dbd0ffe1cb1844988c87407262a33d19?pvs=21)’. Each celestial body has a unique aspect, allowing your empire to grow in power. Each celestial body also has variations in its base stats, with some being significantly easier to seize. Some also only spawn within particular level ranges or space types, so it can be useful to know where and when you might encounter the varying types.
