# Space

# Design

In game, Space (by-default) is viewed as the deep blue regions of space. These regions spawn celestial bodies with three different biome types - Desert, Swamp, & Tundra. The notable difference to other space-types is that Space only spawns celestial bodies up to level 5, and the planets which spawn can only be upgraded a maximum of 4 times (unless playing on custom maps where these parameters are removed).

# Gameplay

The nearest Space space-type is where players quickly begin heading towards after spawning into the game. The celestial bodies which spawn still have moderately-high defense (half that of Nebula), so the areas are still somewhat “safe”, but for this same reason, it becomes easier for players to expand to new and larger planets within the region, rather than within Nebula. Space also allows players to begin finding artifacts to help increase their planets effectiveness, as well as providing a slightly higher maximum level of planets which players can capture. However, Space is still just a stepping stone to the main regions of the universe, as the reduced maximum level (5) and upgrades (4) mean that these don’t stay strong for long, as other players will certainly begin to reach Deep Space and Dead Space quickly.

As you continue to expand into deeper and deeper space, you will begin to find that Space tends to become zones to watch closely - keeping a lookout for other players which may be beginning to expand into your deeper regions of the universe. Space also provides artifacts with particular stat boosts, which may be valuable to reach the win condition of the round being played.
