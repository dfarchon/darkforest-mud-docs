# 0.1 Dark Forest Intro

Firstly, Dark Forest operates as a **ZK (Zero Knowledge) game**, utilizing ZK circuits to establish a fog of war on the public blockchain. 

Secondly, Dark Forest is a **fully onchain game**, with all game logic stored directly on the blockchain. This allows players to interact with the smart contracts using various methods. 
Within the Dark Forest community, a plethora of modified clients and plugins have emerged. Additionally, community members develop smart contracts that directly interact with Dark Forest contracts to introduce various functionalities. This integration of newly developed smart contract systems with the original game contracts enhances the player experience, a concept we refer to as **permissionless interoperability**.

Thirdly, it is a **real-time strategy game**, with players from around the globe actively participating in the ever-open universe. Social interaction among players is a fundamental aspect of the gameplay experience.
