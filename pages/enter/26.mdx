# 2.6 Exploring the map

You might have noticed that there are a few planets nearby, but none further out…


where are all the planets???

The white cursor/crosshair shows where you are currently exploring the map. This is an important part of Dark Forest. By default, the explorer will search in a square, centered on your home planet. However, this can be changed by using the **~** key. Press this, and select a new part of the map!


I chose a little bit to the left of my planets, however you can choose to explore *anywhere* within the universe - what wonders might await at the center?

You may have noticed the toolbar at the bottom left. This is the explorer toolbar.


This allows you to select how many of your computers cores are used to explore the map, and there are even options for how you want it to explore, other than a square. You can also pause the explorer if you need to actually do some *work* on your computer…


There is also advanced exploration functionality for map exploration, by connecting to your GPU using plugins.


admin controls are not available in the actual round, and are for our internal testing purposes.

This is, however, out of scope for this guide. Though I encourage you to “explore” the possibilities of this if you are enjoying the game!

If you are a part of a group playing the game together, you can also share your map. This can be done in two ways.

(1) Export/import everything through settings


There are risks involved - someone may send you a fake map! Make sure you trust the person sharing the map with you.
Also, be warned that large maps can take a loooong time to load in after they are imported.

(2) Export/import certain levels through the DFArchon plugin ”Map Filter Export“


admin controls are not available in the actual round, and are for our internal testing purposes.

This plugin offers better functionality, and can improve load times by allowing you to share only planets above a certain level (there are a lot more lower level planets than high level planets).

Hopefully now you will have been able to capture a couple more planets (or maybe even some other types of celestial bodies!) that you have discovered in the fog of war. You are well on your way to conquering the universe!


This expansion pattern is how you will become a worthy competitor. 

In the next sections, we will take a look at the specific of DFAres v0.1 Round 3: Kardasehv’s win conditions and gameplay changes. If you are new to Dark Forest, I recommend continuing your expansion and tinkering around with the other mechanics (such as upgrading planets with the silver from asteroid fields) before getting too in depth with the update.

In no time, your universe will start feeling much bigger!
