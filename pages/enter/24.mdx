# 2.4 Settings & Private Key Export

The first thing you must do is ensure your private key is safe! The accounts private key can be found in the settings which can be found by pressing the hotkey **j** , or pressing the gear icon on the left of the UI.


Pressing this will bring up the settings pane:


Here, we can scroll down for more settings! Lets scroll down to where we can export the private key!


Read carefully! Don‚Äôt share this with anyone, or they can steal your account! Click the red button 8 times to view the private key information.


the private key shown here is for a publicly known hardhat dev wallet, never send funds to this account, or use for anything other than development/testing purposes!

Clicking the key will show the rest of the key and allow you to copy it somewhere safe(r). You should also note down your home coordinates so that if you change browser or clear cache, you can start mining the map again where your home planet is (or was, hopefully it hasn‚Äôt been captured by your enemies)!


Now that you have saved your private key somewhere safe (remember, this is the ONLY way to recover your account), lets take a look at some other settings.

Scrolling down further‚Ä¶

The popups at the start are pretty annoying, right? If you didn‚Äôt already choose to auto-confirm transactions, you have another chance! If you are using plugins or automation tools then these popups would certainly complicate the process. Luckily, in the settings you can set the transactions to auto-confirm! This will make your gameplay much smoother!


There is also the option to import/export (copy) your map to share with your friends/guildmates (or maybe sell to a willing buyer)?

Thats all for now. You can explore the rest of the settings later in the game üîç
