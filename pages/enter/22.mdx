Let now see how we can get an account. Just to make sure you are following along, check that you can see a screen like this:


This is the first time to open the client, so don‚Äôt have option (a) login with existing account

**If the cursor is not solid, you left-click the line to make the cursor becomes solid.** 

From here, we can see that there are some options for us.
Next you can press [a], [n], [i], [s] to choose the options, then press [enter] to continue.

### *(a) Login with existing account*

This option is for if you have already loaded in/created an account previously. Selecting it will then provide you with the list of accounts you have logged in with before. You can select them using numbers. In this instance, I am choosing my second account.


Please now visit    to see what to do next üòÅ

### *(n) Generate new burner wallet account*

This option is for those who have not yet created an account, and don‚Äôt want to import their own wallet/private key (this is the recommendation, as private keys are stored in the browsers local storage, which is ‚ö†Ô∏èrelatively insecure‚ö†Ô∏è).


As we can see, a fresh burner wallet was created for us. Please read the warnings! Make sure you backup your private key before clearing cache. You will not be able to recover your account if you lose the private key.

After entering the game, you can export the private key in the settings pane.

Please now visit [*Account chosen!*]()   to see what to do next üòÅ

### *(i) Import private key*

This option can be used to reimport your account if you clear your cache, use a different browser/computer, or if you have a specific wallet you wish to import. You can paste the wallet private key here, however, you will likely need to type a **‚Äò0x‚Äô** before pasting, as, at least the wallets I use, tend to export the private key with this prefix.


Again, I will warn you that this private key should hold little-to-no funds; just enough to play the game, if necessary.

Please now visit    to see what to do next üòÅ

### *(s) Spectate*

This option is for if you wish to view the currently ongoing round. However, the map will still be hidden in the fog-of-war.

Choosing this option will load you directly into the game, without the usual transactions necessary to spawn a player and allow them to make moves. The miner will start exploring the map at  (0,0), which is the center of universe!



Then press [enter] to enter the game.
Congratulations, you have entered the game in Spectate mode!

### *Account chosen!*

Great! You have chosen your account (whether a previous account, fresh burner wallet, or import key)! Now, the game will begin to load.

*If your account balance < 0.0001 ETH*, it will show some notice 


You can check [How to transfer ETH from L2 to Redstone Mainnet] to get enough ETH 

Again, I will warn you that this private key should hold little-to-no funds; just enough to play the game, if necessary.

left-click below line to make the cursor becomes solid, then press [enter] to continue 
before: 


after: 


Normally you will see: 


 *if your account balance ‚â•0.0001 ETH*, game client will begin to load game states:


This process is fairly quick for the first log in. However, once you have explored more of the map, and you and other players (that you can see) have begun taking over the universe and making moves, this loading will take longer.

Now, you will be asked to spawn. 



I recommend selecting a little way out from the pink coverage. 
Step 1. left-click and  select a position within the blue area to start searching for a planet!

Step 2. left-click the below line to make the cursor becomes solid. 

Step 3. press [enter] to come into next step.

Here, I chose the position (-112967, -37967) and as you can see the search has begun!



This may take a couple of minutes, depending on how powerful your computers processor is. 

Please be patient!

The game will now initiate two transactions, which will pop up in new browser windows - one to spawn you on the planet you just found, and a second to spawn in your spaceships. You may have your browser blocking popups - you will need to disable this and then press enter to try again. The game will warn you if it can‚Äôt push the popup transaction:



You can find how to enable popups here: 

Here is the first transaction. You can click approve, and I would recommend select the ‚ÄòAuto-confirm all transactions except purchases‚Äô option - it will make the game much smoother to play.



**To welcome more players, we have set the entry fee to 0  üòÑ**



Great, now we will have found a planet to spawn on! Lets go ahead and press ENTER.

Once these transactions have completed, you should see your planet in game:



**Congratulations, you enter the game successfully !**

That‚Äôs all for this section. Lets move on to the first gameplay elements!
